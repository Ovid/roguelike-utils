TODO:

Add cross-platform ability to detect the shift and control keys held down while moving.

Find a number pad and test/get it to work on linux/windows.

Figure out how to resize the console on windows. 

Try to get terminal size info via telnet negotiation for non-tty connections in the ANSI lib.

Include a "wilderness" generator.

Maze generators should be loaded like DBI modules... with "genmaze" taking a "method"
 argument, which coresponds to a .pm module sitting in a directory somewhere.

MAYBE:

Maybe switch the map entries over to Area::Entry objects that stringify to symbols

Maybe move Item, Mob over to the Utils namespace?  Maybe wait to see how they develop?
